# Details

The works of Gärdenfors [(2000)](https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/2076.001.0001) and [(2014)](https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/9629.001.0001) provide a detailed introduction to conceptual space theory.

An introduction to conceptual space theory in French is available in LaTeX [at this link](https://github.com/ZygoOoade/conceptual_spaces/blob/main/introduction/introduction%20à%20la%20théorie%20des%20espaces%20conceptuels.tex).

The two files [Figures_RGB_SL.ipynb](https://github.com/ZygoOoade/conceptual_spaces/blob/main/Figures.% 20RGB%20-%20HSL.ipynb) and [Towards_a_Voronoi_Cell.ipynb](https://github.com/ZygoOoade/conceptual_spaces/blob/main/Vers_une_cellule_de_Voronoï. ipynb) were used to generate figures illustrating my point in [this document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aH7IRMDfj3Cjz2B0EjOcGe75CNksNWy0/view?usp=drive_link). More specifically, the second file is used throughout section 1.4.4 of the document, in which we explain precisely how to construct a Voronoi cell by intersecting half-planes.

A LaTeX version of this chapter is available [at this link](https://github.com/ZygoOoade/conceptual_spaces/blob/main/Chap_1.tex)


The file [Tesselations_Voronoi.ipynb](https://github.com/ZygoOoade/conceptual_spaces/blob/main/Tesselations_Voronoi.ipynb) is used to illustrate the model proposed by Douven [(2013)](https://doi.org/ 10.1007/s10992-011-9216-0), [(2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2016.03.007). More detailed code is available on [his GitHub](https://github.com/IgorDouven/LearningConcepts/blob/main/learning_concepts.jl)

The file [Glove__sleep__DRM_visualisation.ipynb](https://github.com/ZygoOoade/conceptual_spaces/blob/main/Glove__sleep__DRM_visualisation.ipynb) was a draft for modeling the DRM effect. It would be better to use more recent embeddings, and also to apply MDS rather than PCA.
